# Python-Keylogger-Oneliner
Proof of concept not using loops, if-else or any switch statements. For the challenge issued by vx-underground (https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1879395134321954958?s=19).

I decided to make it as small as possible and into a one-liner. It works and will log everything you type into a logfile. Exciting stuff.
